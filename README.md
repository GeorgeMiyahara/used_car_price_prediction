# Used_car_price_prediction
## Abstract
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model for estimating the prices of used cars in the USA. We will be using a dataset containing information on 762,091 used cars scraped from cars.com. The data was collected in April 2023, ensuring its relevance and accuracy.

By analyzing the various attributes of the used cars, such as make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and more, we aim to understand the factors that influence the pricing. Our objective is to build a robust machine learning model that can accurately predict the price of a used car based on these attributes.

Throughout the project, we will employ data analysis techniques, including data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). This will help us uncover patterns, relationships, and key features that significantly impact the price of used cars.

Once the data is prepared, we will train and evaluate our predictive model using machine learning algorithms such as regression models. We will split the dataset into training and testing sets to assess the model's performance. Our goal is to create a reliable model that can provide accurate price estimates for used cars.

It's important to note that the dataset covers a specific duration, limited to April 2023, and that the used car market is influenced by various factors beyond the dataset's scope, such as economic conditions and technological advancements. Therefore, the model's predictions should be interpreted within the context of the specific timeframe.

By the end of this project, we aim to provide valuable insights and a predictive model that can assist both buyers and sellers in making informed decisions regarding used car prices.
